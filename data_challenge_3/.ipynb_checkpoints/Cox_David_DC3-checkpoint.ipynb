    "## Breast Cancer Cell Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for the data team at a local research hospital. You've been tasked with developing a means to help doctors diagnose breast cancer. You've been given data about biopsied breast cells; where it is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous).\n",
    "\n",
    "* What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy? Build a model that predicts whether a given biopsied breast cell is benign or malignant.\n",
    "* What features drive your false positive rate for your model you derived above, what features drive your false negative rate?\n",
    "* How would a physician use your product?\n",
    "* There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of detecting malignancy?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for a coherent data-story - think of this challenge as building the MVP of a data product. That means you should be able to explain the “why” behind the technical choices you made and show that you made those choices with your user needs in mind. This is a deliberately open-ended question that provides a chance to showcase your EDA, analysis, and presentation skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "* Your final software deliverable should be a REST API (locally-hosted - in future weeks you will containerize and deploy to AWS) that you will be expected to demo\n",
