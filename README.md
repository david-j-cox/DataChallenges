# Data Challenges
- This repository contains a set of data challenge projects initiated during my time as an Insight data science fellow. 
- For each data challenge, the goal is to spend no more than four hours from opening the files to producing a final report. 
- Each week is a new topic aimed at developing skills in a new area and with a new business target in mind.
