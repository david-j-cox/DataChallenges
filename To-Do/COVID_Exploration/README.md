## The Goal

This is an open-ended data challenge to explore the open source data at [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/). The data is available via API, and you can pull in either json or csv. Some optional challenges:

* can you go beyond a simple data visualization? maybe some predictive analytics/model building?
* is there anything interesting in the data that hasn't been widely discussed/reported yet?
* are there any additional outside data sources that can add value to your analysis?

The open-ended challenge here cuts both ways: there's less pressure to answer a specific question, but also having less structure is going to make it difficult to deliver a polished result. As always, focus on clean code and a solid _data story_.
